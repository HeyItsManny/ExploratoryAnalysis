### Exploratory Data Analysis
Coursera DataScience Course 4 

This repository contains artifacts related to Coursera Data Science Course.  
Module: Exploratory Data Analysis.

The Course Assignment is to demostrate my ability to
create and export different types of graphs:

* Source Data from the web using R
* Save and unzip a data file
* Load the data into R 
* Change Column Class (factor/char/Date)
* Filter Rows by date
* Plot Graphs, format legends, export graphs

### Data Set:
  The Data set linked below contains a file related to Household Electric power consumption. 
  Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

Description 
 The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
 1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
 2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
 3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
 4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
 5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
 6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
 7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and    microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
 8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
 9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
